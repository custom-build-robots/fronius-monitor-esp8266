# Fronius solar monitor based on an ESP8266 node MCU
This is my ESP8266 Node MCU Fronius monitor to check and monitory the KPIs I am interested in.
I implemented two buttons to control as well a warm water pump in our house and an electric stove for heating the living room. 

I will update the readme very soon for some more details. In the meantime visit my blog.
